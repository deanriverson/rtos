# rtos
A very simple real-time operating system for the ARM Cortex M4 (TI MSP432).  This RTOS was developed as a
project for UT.RTBN.12.01x, a course on Realtime Bluetooth Networks on [edx.org](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UTAustinX+UT.RTBN.12.01x+3T2016/info).

Note that this project does not compile as is.  This is just a stash of the source files I wrote during the course.  Each lab is on a separate branch.
